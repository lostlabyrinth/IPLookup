# IPLookup

A plugin for Limnoria which allows for a user to lookup the location and ISP data for a specified IP address.

Initially based on the GeoIP script from [![Assorted](https://github.com/reticulatingspline/Assorted)], the idea was spun off into its own plugin in order to accomodate more detail relating to an IP address, such as location and ISP, as well as enabling geoip API that supports hostnames and IPv6.

## Usage

```
!ip <IP address>
```

That's all there is to it!
